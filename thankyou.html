  <h1>Thank you for your participation!</h1>
  <p>Your order has been recorded.</p>
  <p>Debrief participants after their session (e.g., a thankyou.html page that explains the purpose and that some manipulations were intentionally deceptive). Offer opt-out (delete their data) at that time.</p>
  <h2>Delete My Data</h2>
  <p>If you wish to withdraw your data from the study, you can delete all information associated with your anonymous session.
    This will remove all your records from our research database permanently.</p>
