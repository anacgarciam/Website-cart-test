    <h1>Welcome to the Webshop Experiment</h1>
    <p>Instructions: You will be taken to a webshop. Please explore and complete a purchase if you wish.</p>
    <button id="start-btn">Start Experiment</button>
    <p>You are invited to participate in a short study about online shopping experiences. During this study, you will interact with a simulated online shop. Your actions (such as time spent, pages visited, and products added to cart) will be recorded anonymously for research purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> This is <em>not</em> a real shop — you will not be charged or asked for any payment details.
    The goal is to understand how different website designs influence shopping behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    Participation is voluntary and anonymous. You can leave the study at any time by closing the browser tab.
    By clicking “Start”, you consent to participate and allow your anonymous interaction data to be used for research.
